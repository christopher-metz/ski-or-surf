# Galvanize Web Development Immersive
## Quarter 1 Project

### Project Name
Ski or Surf

### Problem
In Western Washington you can ski and surf all winter, and it is hard to predict which will have better conditions without spending a long time studying weather data.

### Primary User
The primary user of this website is a busy skier and surfer in Western Washington. Spencer works a lot Monday through Friday, but has a flexible schedule. He has the ability to call in sick to work to go skiing or surfing. However, in order to have this flexibility he ends up working long hours the other times. He doesn't have the time to spend studying weather data and forecasting websites.

### Solution
This website allows him to quickly make a decision of what sport to do that day based off of weather conditions.

###Features
The main landing page is a nice photo and some text showing the user what to do that day and where to go. There is a menu icon in the top left that will open up a side bar with links to specific forecasting websites.

### Web APIs
Surfline API, Powderlines API

### Technology
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Materialize, AJAX

###Future
In the future I would love to open it up to all the surfing spots in Washington and all the best skiing regions. The user would then be able to add his or her own rules for conditions. This allows the user to know there own spot and what conditions are best for that place and add it to the website. I would also like to add a loading bar if the API calls are taking too long. Lastly, I would like to add an API for great surfing and skiing photography as opposed to just the same picture every time.
