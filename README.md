# Galvanize Web Development Immersive
## Quarter 1 Project

### Project Name
Ski or Surf

### Problem
In Western Washington you can ski and surf all winter, and it is hard to predict which will have better conditions without spending a long time studying weather data.

### Primary User
The primary user of this website is a busy skier and surfer in Western Washington. Spencer works a lot Monday through Friday, but has a flexible schedule. He has the ability to call in sick to work to go skiing or surfing. However, in order to have this flexibility he ends up working long hours the other times. He doesn't have the time to spend studying weather data and forecasting websites.

### Solution
This website allows him to quickly make a decision of what sport to do that day based off of weather conditions.

### Web APIs
Surfline API, Powderlines API

### Technology
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Materialize, AJAX

### What was the most valuable piece of Customer feedback you received?
The most valuable piece of customer feedback I received is to make the text blend in with the background better. It looks bad to just have plain black text.

### What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?
Finding the right API to get data that will work for my weather models.
